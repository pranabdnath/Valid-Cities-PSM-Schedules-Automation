This script automates the extraction, filtering, and processing of scheduling data received through email. It reads the latest email with a specific subject line, retrieves a ZIP file containing CSV data, and then separates the data into different sheets based on city groups and conditions. It also marks rows with a 30-day logic flag and maintains a log of every run.
